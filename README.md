# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

## Purpose of this Repository

**These implementations for learning purpose. The solution would be provided in C/C++ Programming Language.**

I am planning to cover all those topics which i include below, You may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations. You are welcomed to contribute in this repository.
